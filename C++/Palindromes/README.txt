*********** Important Points about Palindrome **********
1. If a given string is of even length: Then the string will be a palindrome only when all of its characters have even number of occurrences.

2. If a given string is of odd length: Then the string will be a palindrome only if all characters except one have even number of occurrences while the left out character
   has only a unique occurrence. 
   In an even length string, this left out character has 0 occurrences.
